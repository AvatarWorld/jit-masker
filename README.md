# Zoom Matting Project

This is a shared Pytorch repository between several teams working on efficient
portrait matting on video streams.

The main approach will be based on [JITNet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02699.pdf).

## Getting started

Install requirements with

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

Alternatively, install them yourself with Conda somehow. You know the drill.
